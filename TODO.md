# To Do

## Features

* **"Grosser Block":** Select MxN tiles at once for placement, from the tileset or tilemap
* **Auto-Load:** Guess the associated tileset for a tilemap
* **.tileset files:** Read and export lists of images with start+offset+length values
* Native-looking build on Mac OS X (involves publishing an app bundle release, and using the system menu bar)
* Scale the UI for high-DPI displays
* Generate tilemap images from the command line
* Allow undo/redo for resize operations
