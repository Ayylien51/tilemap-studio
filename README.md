# Tilemap Studio

A tilemap editor for [pokecrystal](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal), [pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered), and hacks including [Polished Crystal](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal), [Red++](https://github.com/TheFakeMateo/RedPlusPlus), [Orange](https://github.com/PiaCarrot/pokeorange), [Prism](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonPrism), and many more.

Inspired by [GSC Town Map Editor](https://hax.iimarckus.org/topic/97/) and [Karteneditor](https://i.imgur.com/70jDfdM.png), but implemented with C++ and [FLTK](http://www.fltk.org/), and with support for tilemaps beyond the Town Map.

Latest prerelease: [**0.1.0**](https://github.com/Rangi42/tilemap-studio/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

Follow the steps in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to install the release copy of Tilemap Studio, or the longer instructions to build it yourself from source.

The [example/](example/) directory contains tilemaps and tileset graphics for three different kinds of Town Map. Each one uses a different format: **pokered/town_map.rle** is an RBY Town Map, **pokecrystal/\*.bin** are GSC Town Maps, and **polishedcrystal/\*.bin** are PC Town Maps.
